# Elasticsearch Using Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch Nuget Package 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/current/index.html 

The NEST nuget package for Elasticsearch has reached the end of its life and has been replaced with the new nuget package Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch   

Reason for new package 

The NEST client was officially deprecated starting with version 8.13 and will reach its end-of-life by the end of the year. Developers should begin migrating to Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch to avoid any disruptions.

Why the Change?
1. Simplified Codebase:
   The new client, Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch, was completely redesigned to make it easier to maintain and develop.

2. Automatic Code Generation:
   Instead of manually managing Elasticsearch's huge API (over 450 endpoints and nearly 3000 types), the new client uses automatic code generation. This ensures the client is  
 always up-to-date and aligned with the Elasticsearch server.

3. Better Long-Term Support:
  Manually maintaining such a vast API had become unsustainable. The new approach focuses on maintainability and consistency, making it easier to manage updates and new   features.

4. Future-Proof Your Applications:
   Migrating to Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch ensures compatibility with the latest server features and reduces risks from outdated or deprecated functionality.


In short, upgrading to Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch will simplify your code, ensure long-term support, and keep your applications ready for the future.
